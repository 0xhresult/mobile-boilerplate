# Frequently asked questions


### Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed the `head`.

The advantage to placing it in the `head` is that you will track a user's
pageview even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded. However,
putting the code at the bottom keeps all the scripts together and reinforces
that scripts at the bottom are the right move.


### What is profiling, and how do I use it, why do I want it?

[Firebug](http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/10/firebug-tutorial-logging-profiling-and-commandline-part-ii)
and [Chrome Dev
tools](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/profiles.html) offer
profiling, but there is no easy way to profile IE6 and IE7. If you're focused
on providing the most responsive experience possible (you should be!) then
profiling should be part of your development workflow.


### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.


### Where can I get help for support questions?

Please ask for help on
